          Our core values are a starting point and help define what we do it.
          They underlie the passion that drives us to be better and different.
          They allow the freedoms of our entrepreneurial organization, where
          people are empowered to make decisions, to make a difference with
          their ideas and hard work, to find solutions and challenge traditional
          ways of doing things
